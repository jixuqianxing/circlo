Circlo
======

Circlo is an ambient audiovisual clock for iPhone and iPad. Design and programming by Johan Halin. Sound by Hannu Kuosmanen.

Circlo is mostly an experiment in doing an atypical user experience with UIKit. There are definitely some questionable (and outright stupid) code design decisions in Circlo, but I've learned to forgive myself about that.

Circlo uses [CocosDenshion](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone) for playing audio, and the [Sniglet](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sniglet) typeface by Haley Fiege. I've included these directly in the repository. If this is a problem, please contact me.
